Introduction: Linux Kernel development using kworkflow
======================================================

Overview
========

Linux Kernel as a project
-------------------------

* Linux kernel is a giant puzzle where each piece is a subsystem.
* All subsystems have their repository and their way to work.
* Some numbers from the kernel 5.6 release:

 * 12,665 non-merge
 * 1,712 developers
 * More than 207 companies

About kw
========

What is kw?
-----------

It is a set of scripts that aim to reduce the environment and setup overhead
for developing for GNU/Linux. 

Why you should use kw?
----------------------

* Everybody that works with Linux Kernel creates their set of scripts, which
  means that we have a lot of code duplication.

 We want to centralize most of the tedious work in a single tool.

* Developing for Linux Kernel has a steep learning curve.
